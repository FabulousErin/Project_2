# Project_2

Our project will illustrate crop production by state in the US. Our user will be able to click on a state in a map to find out what are the top 5 crops produced in that state, how crop yields have changed over time in that state, and how total field crop area has changed over the past 10 years. 
USDA data from NASS Quikstats will be the source for our information: https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/
Our charts will be:
1.	Top 5 crop production value ($) – pie chart (download all crops, filter by data item name that has $ in it and replace/filter non-numeric numbers)
2.	Yields for past 10 years – drop down menu to choose crop, make line chart with y-axis adjusting for units
3.	Area -field crop totals past 10 years – bar chart
